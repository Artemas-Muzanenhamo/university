# University App

This is a simple application to demonstrate the power of 
`Spring-Data`. Instead of us creating CRUD _APIs_, `Spring-Data`
really helps us with providing generic APIs that we may want/need 
in the future based on your defined model.

Some more information on `Spring-Data` is found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/).
